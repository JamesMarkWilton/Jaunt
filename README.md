Jaunt is an application which allows users to find and share their jaunts. Jaunts are
short excursions or journies for pleasure.

The Problem
-----------
As a user on my day off I always do the same thing, I go to a local coffee shop then I go for a
walk around downtown and people watch, after that I get a burger and a beer at my favorite pub.
But this is boring and I do it everytime I have a day off so I want an idea of what other people
around me do when they have time off.

The Process
-----------
Creating a Jaunt Iteration 1
- [] I go to the jaunt homepage and see a link to create a new Jaunt
- [] I click the link
- [] I am now on the new jaunt page that has a form to add a location, and a description of what I do at this location
- [] I only have an option to walk to my next location
- [] I can put the same info about the next location
- [] I Submit this infomation and I see that my jaunt is listed out with first location and description then travel method then
		second location and description
